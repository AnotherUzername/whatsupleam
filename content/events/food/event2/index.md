## Get Ready to Get Sticky!

Join us for a sweet and memorable afternoon at "Jam Making in the Park"! This special community workshop is a perfect opportunity to learn the timeless art of preserving fruit, all while enjoying the beautiful surroundings of Leamington Spa. Whether you're a seasoned preserver or have never made jam before, this event is designed for all skill levels.

### What to Expect

This hands-on workshop will be a delightful experience for everyone involved. Here's a taste of what you'll be doing:

* **Learn from the Best:** Our expert jam maker will guide you through the entire process, from preparing the fruit to sterilising jars and creating the perfect set.
* **A Taste of the Season:** We'll be using fresh, locally sourced fruit to ensure the most delicious and flavourful jam. You'll leave with your very own jar of jam to take home and enjoy!
* **Community and Conversation:** It's more than just a classâ€”it's a chance to connect with your neighbours and share a passion for good food and tradition.
* **Tips and Tricks:** Discover the secrets to making jam that lasts, how to experiment with different flavour combinations, and what tools you'll need to continue your jam-making journey at home.
